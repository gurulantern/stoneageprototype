Stone Age Game

This is a game I am developing to be played in Synthesis-style, with a teacher and facilitator. 
Kids will play through this simulation which will have long term affects on their later games. 
This will be the first installment in a history based simulation. 

Basic Controls:
 - WASD : Move up, down, left, right
 - Left Click : Gather
 - Right Click : Observe
 - F : Sleep

Basic Mechanics:
 - Players have a stamina bar which decreases over time and once it is low enough, player speed will decrease and their avatar will look tired
 - To replenish stamina, players must sleep which will immoblize them and disable other functionalities until the stamina bar is full again
 - Players can go up to Fruit Trees to gather food with a left click. 
 - Players can also observe with a right click and fill the team's observe meter. This click will not gather food.
 - Players can walk over ripe ground fruit to regain stamina without sleeping.
 - Players can take their gathered food and store in their cave to be scored at the end of the game. 
 - To win a game, a team or alliance must finish with the most food in their cave. 
 - The game is timed and will end with a game over screen when the timer is finished.

Controls and Mechanics to be added:
 - Scare : Space bar - Players will be able to repel rival teams with a scare move. This move will only be unlocked for desperate teams, teams that have been last at least twice.
 - Multiplayer with Colyseus - Players will be the color of their team and be able to compete against other teams. 
 - Create : C - Players will unlock the ability to create farm land and shelter by filling their observe meter a certain number of times. 
 - Alliances - Players can establish alliances to combine food scores in order to beat other teams. This will only be unlocked after the first several games of Scare being unlocked.
